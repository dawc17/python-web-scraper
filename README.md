# python-web-scraper
another simple project of mine
i wanted to make a quick web scraper in python to learn some more
the result was this, a scraper that only works on websites that do not have bot protection (cloudflare sites are a good example)
the url needs to be specified in the code, as well as the tags youre looking for
it uses requests and beautifulsoup4
